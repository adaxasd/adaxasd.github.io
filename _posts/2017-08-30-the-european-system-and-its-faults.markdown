After the Brexit referendum, German chancellor Angela Merkel stated that "we can be proud of our common European values: freedom, democracy
and the rule of law". However, after a close-up analysis of the European system, this statement can easily be dismissed.

In the EU, there are three main legislative bodies: the European Parliament, the European Commission and the Council of the European Union.
The European parliament is democratically speaking better off than the Commission since it (at least) is voted for by the people. However,
the votes cast are not cast equal; for example, Malta, which has 400,000 inhabitants, is represented with six seats in the European 
parliament and Germany holds only 96 seats for 82 million inhabitants. This inadvertently leads to a Maltese vote being 12.8 times more
"important" for the European Parliament than a German one, which is a definitive breach of one of the core principles of a democracy
(namely the right to a general, direct, free, secret and EQUAL vote). White a somewhat fair representation of all countries would lead to
an unmanagable number of representatives, a system could be implemented in which each EU citizen gets to cast one vote for a representative
of their own country and another vote for a representative of any other EU member country. This would make the European Parliament somewhat
more democratic.

Far worse off, democratically speaking, is the Council of the European Union. It is not voted for, and instead is made up of ministers from
the governments of the EU. This results in persons who hold executive functions in their respective governments also having legislative
powers in the EU - this is nothing but a clear breach of the separation of powers. Furthermore, the Council of the EU has a distinctive
lack of transparency: Up to the treaty of Lissabon, all meetings of the Council of the EU were not open for the public. However, since the
treaty, not much has changed: The most important meetings, those concerning "general matters" and "foreign matters" are still held 
non-publicly.

But worst of all of them is European Commission. It is also not voted for, instead it is appointed by the governments of the EU. The
populus has no say in who gets to represent "them" in the Commission. Even the European Parliament, which is voted for by the people, 
cannot appoint people to be in the European Commission, they can only accept or deny the entry of people appointed by the governments.
Worst of all, the European Commission has the right of initiative in the legislative procedure in the European Union, meaning that it 
 - and only it - can initiate laws. This results in the governments having more of a say in the EU than the people - two out of three
legislative organs directly represent the governments, and they have more legislative powers than the one that is voted for. Add to this 
the facts that most laws are discussed beforehand in the intransparent and informal "Trilogue" between members of all legislative organs,
and that Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Commission, called the European Parliament "ridiculous"
and you can see why, as one member of the European Parliament put it, the EU parliament is just a "parliament of protocol".

This lack of democracy, of course, is reflected by a lack of interest by the voter: For years now, the participation rate in EU elections
has been going down. Interestingly enough, the EU is probably also the only government-like entity in which a vast majority of its
nocitizens do not know their "Head of State".

All of these factors combined lead to the conclusion that the EU needs urgent democratic reforms, if possible even with elements of a
direct democracy. The question is just wether it is going to do that, and the answer is probably not.
